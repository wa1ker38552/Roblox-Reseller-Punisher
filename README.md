# Roblox-Reseller-Punisher
A simple script to send messages to people who resell new limiteds for a loss.

I encourage everyone who sees this to use this script to annoy 8 year olds who don't understand how the concept of an economy works.
Using data from this script, I can see that most of the users can't send messages which means they have it turned off or are under 13.

The script takes the original price as an input and item id and calculates the minimum a user needs to sell an item before it is sold at a loss. 
Then any user on that items page that sells it for less than this calculated threshold gets sent a *special* message.

Have fun using this!
